# UWaterloo Fitness Assistant

Please note the following: 

1. Due to the sudden closure of school facilities, the location closure dates and available activity times were taken from March 6 for demonstration purposes. If actually deployed, then the app would show no available fitness options due to the closure of all facilties. 

2. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

3. To run the project:
- Please download and unzip the folder or clone to your desired folder.
- Change the API Key and clientId in apiGoogleconfig.json. They are not shown on Github for privacy purposes.

- In Terminal, navigate to the project directory (FitnessAssistant-master) and run the following two lines: 
    npm install
